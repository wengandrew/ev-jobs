              development of automation to help create a better world for

              significant strides in the adoption and proliferation of
              automation spurred by technological advances in computing,
              sensing, networking, and communications. Breakthroughs in
              artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, which may
              currently be the most important general-purpose technologies
              (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2017), have broadened the scope of
              automation beyond mechanized labor and industrial robotics to
              knowledge work and cognitive agents. Machines increasingly not
              only perform repetitive, routine tasks in predictable
              environments but also are being deployed to make complex

  abstract  = "Recent economic events have sparked debates over the degree of
               structural mismatch in the U.S. economy. One of the most
               frequent claims is that workers lack the skills that employers
               demand. The existing literature, however, analyzes this
               potential mismatch at a high level of aggregation with abstract
               indices and noisy proxies that obscure the underlying
               mechanisms. The authors address these issues by presenting and
               analyzing results from a survey of U.S. manufacturing
               establishments. The survey is the first, to their knowledge, to
               directly measure concrete employer skill demands and hiring
               experiences in a nationally representative survey at the
               industry level. The findings indicate that demand for
               higher-level skills is generally modest, and that three-quarters
               of manufacturing establishments do not show signs of hiring
               difficulties. Among the remainder, demands for higher-level math
               and reading skills are significant predictors of long-term
               vacancies, but demands for computer skills and other
               critical-thinking/problem-solving skills are not. Of particular
               interest, high-tech plants do not experience greater levels of
               hiring challenges. When the authors examine the potential
               mechanisms that could contribute to hiring difficulties, they
               find that neither external regional supply conditions nor
               internal firm practices are predictive of hiring problems.
               Rather, the data show that establishments that are members of
               clusters or that demand highly specialized skills have the
               greatest probability of incurring long-term vacancies. The
               authors interpret these results as a sign that it is important
               to think about factors that complicate the interaction of supply
               and demand?such as disaggregation and communication/coordination
               failures?rather than simply focusing on inadequate labor supply.",

                 seek to offer some description of engineering work by looking
                 in detail at a specific manufacturing industry---firms that
                 supply automakers---to gain insight into how engineers create
                 innovation. Autos account for 5\% of US GDP and in 2011, 70\%
                 of auto suppliers contributed design effort, a task typically
                 performed by engineers, making the auto supply chain an
                 important context in which to study engineering and
                 innovation. Some highlights from our original survey data
                 include a wide range in terms of size and strategies of supply
                 chain companies; a majority was small- to medium-sized, often
                 family-owned. We observed barriers to patenting for
                 manufacturing firms developing process rather than product
                 innovations. And interviews revealed the importance of
                 customers for the innovative efforts of supplier firms.
                 Certain Japanese customers were preferred because they shared
                 expertise and helped suppliers improve, while other, American,
                 customers were viewed as having unreasonable demands for
                 regular, incremental price reductions and did not offer

  abstract  = "The important role of justice in energy transition technologies
               has been a topic of increasing interest in recent years.
               However, key questions remain about how inequities influence
               energy transition innovations (ETIs) from their design to their
               widespread use, which ETIs receive more funding, and who
               controls ETI research, prototyping and deployment. Here we
               propose a framework to centre justice in energy transition
               innovations (CJI) and examine how three tenets of justice
               (recognition, procedural and distributional justice) influence
               each level of ETI, including niche, regime and landscape levels.
               We examine wind energy in Mexico and multiple ETIs in Los
               Angeles as use cases to show how our CJI framework can help
               reveal the specific inequities undermining just energy
               transitions at crucial analytical levels of ETI in practice. Our
               CJI framework offers a path for promoters, practitioners and
               underserved communities to target the problems these groups face
               and create ETIs that better address their specific aspirations,
               needs and circumstances. Justice is increasingly recognized as a
               core proposition for energy transitions, but questions remain
               about how it manifests in energy transition innovations. This
               Perspective introduces a framework for centring justice
               consideration in these innovations across levels, illustrating
               its use through two case studies.",

              environmentally sustainable. In particular, one concern is the
              impact on manufacturing labor. Prior studies of the anticipated
              impacts of vehicle electrification on manufacturing labor
              requirements are mixed, with some suggesting that producing EVs
              may require fewer labor hours and jobs than conventional gasoline
              vehicles and some suggesting that there will be limited impacts
              on labor outcomes. Moreover, analysis of labor implications has
              been hindered by a lack of shop floor-level data on the labor
              hours required for ICEV and EV manufacturing. We collect detailed
              data on the production process steps required to build key ICEV
              and battery electric vehicle (BEV) powertrain components and the
              labor required for each process step. The data include
              information for 252 process steps, which we collected from the
              shop floors of leading automotive manufacturers and combine with
              information on a further 78 process steps found in the existing
              literature. We then use this data to build a production process
              model that determines the labor hours required to produce ICEV
              and BEV powertrain components in a variety of scenarios of
              different production volumes and labor efficiency levels. We find
              that, in all scenarios we explore, the labor intensity required
              for the manufacturing of BEV powertrain components is larger than
              for ICEV powertrain components. Our results imply that vehicle
              electrification may lead to more jobs in powertrain
              manufacturing, at least in the short- to medium-term. These
              results emphasize the importance of using information about
              manufacturing process tasks and labor requirements to estimate
              the labor impacts of EVs, rather than recent approaches

                 toward electric vehicles (EVs) in the automotive sector.
                 Although hybrid electric vehicles have been part of the U.S.
                 vehicle fleet for more than two decades, and some mass-market
                 EVs have been available for over a decade, battery electric
                 vehicles (BEVs), which are powered exclusively by a battery
                 and an electric motor, currently make up a small part of U.S.
                 auto sales. And the batteries and other drivetrain components
                 in BEVs are largely made by non-U.S. suppliers. The coming
                 shift toward BEVs is a transformational change to the industry
                 that is by now inevitable. Given that this shift is coming,
                 the most important question for policymakers is how the shift
                 will be managed. Smart policy can transform this industry
                 upheaval into a new beginning for U.S. producers and the
                 rebuilding of a foundation for good jobs. If instead policy
                 remains on autopilot through the upcoming transformation, the
                 shift will instead reduce U.S. employment and further batter
                 job quality in the auto sector.",

              that these workers could leverage their mobility to other

              today's fossil fuel extraction workers are not co-located with

              accounting for federal employment projections, fossil fuel
              extraction workers are mostly not located in the regions where
              green employment will grow despite attaining the appropriate

              interesting experiments in the history of the automotive
              industry---one of the first transplants of a Japanese auto
              manufacturer into an American culture. It is the story of New
              United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI), a Toyota-General Motors
              (GM) 50:50 joint venture that started in 1984. NUMMI is located
              in Fremont, California. Fremont is just east of San Francisco Bay
              between Oakland to the north and San Jose to the south. Although
              this story has been told many times and much research has been
              done on NUMMI, I believe it is such a remarkable one that
              retelling it anew is worth the effort. Furthermore, it provides
              another insight into how the Japanese have dramatically
              influenced automobile and other manufacturing in the U.S. In fact
              I first heard of NUMMI when I went to work for the Douglas
              Aircraft Co. (DAC), a part of McDonnell Douglas in 1989. As I
              recall, the executive in charge of implementing DAC's then
              nascent total quality management (TQM) program was hired away
              from NUMMI to take advantage of his knowledge in that area.",

  abstract = "The Fremont California-based NUMMI plant was long considered a
              model of high-skill, high-productivity manufacturing, as the
              facility produced some of the highest quality vehicles in the
              world for almost three decades until its closure in 2010. I argue
              that NUMMI's success was due to its collective bargaining
              agreement because it leveraged workers' fullest effort and skill
              because it ensured them job security, a living wage, and
              protected them from capricious management. The presence of a
              union and a collective bargaining agreement mandated that workers
              avoid disputes with management and collaborate with managers on
              streamlining production in exchange for compensation and related
              guarantees and ensured smooth, consistent and high quality work.
              Some interpreted NUMMI's closure in 2010 as a referendum on
              union-supported wages, health care benefits and pensions at
              General Motors. My research shows that General Motors' failure
              was due primarily to financial problems, poor managerial
              decisions, rises in health care costs, undesirable product
              lineups and overinvestment in trucks and SUV's. General Motors
              also played a conspicuous role in the financial meltdown through
              its subsidiaries. General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC)
              financed hundreds of billions of dollars in mortgage-based assets
              of suspect credit quality that helped create this multi-trillion
              dollar mortgage-backed asset market that collapsed in the global
              meltdown of the financial sector in 2008. I argue that NUMMI and
              case studies from other automotive plants show that, despite a
              recession and global competition, lowering the wages of American
              workers and slashing their benefits undermines key sources of
              American competitive strength and represents the incorrect policy
              posture for the American economy.",

                  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released proposed guidance on
                  the clean vehicle provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act
                  (IRA) that are lowering costs for consumers, spurring a boom
                  in U.S. manufacturing, and strengthening energy security by
                  building resilient supply chains with allies and partners.
                  Since the IRA was enacted, nearly $100 billion in
                  private-sector investment has been announced across the U.S.
                  clean vehicle and battery supply chain.``The Inflation
                  Reduction Act has unleashed an investment and manufacturing
                  boom in the United States, and since President Biden enacted
                  the law, ecosystems have developed in communities nationwide
                  to onshore the clean vehicle supply chain,'' said Secretary
                  of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. ``The Inflation Reduction
                  Act's clean vehicle tax credit saves consumers up to $7,500
                  on a new clean vehicle and hundreds of dollars per year on
                  gas, while creating American manufacturing jobs and
                  strengthening our energy security.''``President Biden entered
                  office determined to reverse the decades-long trend of
                  letting jobs and factories go overseas to China,'' said John
                  Podesta, Senior Advisor to the President for Clean Energy
                  Innovation and Implementation. ``Thanks to the Investing in
                  America agenda and today's important guidance from Treasury
                  and the Department of Energy, we're helping ensure that the
                  electric vehicle future will be made in America.''Today's
                  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NRPM) provides clarity and
                  certainty around the IRA's foreign entity of concern (FEOC)
                  requirements. To strengthen the security of America's supply
                  chains, beginning in 2024, an eligible clean vehicle may not
                  contain any battery components that are manufactured or
                  assembled by a FEOC, and, beginning in 2025, an eligible
                  clean vehicle may not contain any critical minerals that were
                  extracted, processed, or recycled by a FEOC. In conjunction
                  with today's Treasury NPRM, the Department of Energy has
                  released proposed guidance defining what entities are a
                  FEOC.In addition to the FEOC requirement, clean vehicles must
                  also continue to meet additional statutory criteria,
                  including additional sourcing requirements for both the
                  critical minerals and battery components contained in the
                  vehicle, a requirement that vehicles undergo final assembly
                  in North America, and a requirement that vehicles do not
                  exceed a Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price of $80,000 for
                  a van, pickup truck, or sport utility vehicle, or $55,000 for
                  any other vehicle. Foreign Entity of Concern RequirementThe
                  NPRM provides proposed rules to determine whether applicable
                  critical minerals (and their associated constituent
                  materials) and battery components are manufactured or
                  assembled by a FEOC for battery components, and extracted,
                  processed, or recycled by a FEOC for critical minerals. The
                  proposed rules would require manufacturers to conduct due
                  diligence that complies with industry standards of tracing
                  for battery materials.Under the proposal, FEOC-compliance for
                  battery components would be determined at the time of
                  manufacture or assembly, and FEOC-compliance for critical
                  minerals would be determined by reviewing all phases of
                  applicable critical mineral extraction, processing, and
                  recycling. For example, a mineral extracted by an entity that
                  is not a FEOC but processed by an entity that is a FEOC would
                  not be compliant. Compliant battery components would have to
                  be tracked to FEOC-compliant battery cells, and cells could
                  not be manufactured or assembled by a FEOC.Critical minerals
                  generally also must be traced. However, given that there is
                  commingling in the critical mineral supply chains and
                  suppliers may not be able to physically track certain
                  specific masses of minerals to specific battery cells or
                  batteries, the NPRM asks for comments on a temporary
                  transition rule, under which critical minerals and associated
                  constituent materials may be allocated to a particular set of
                  battery cells. The battery cells would then have to be
                  physically tracked to batteries and new clean vehicles using
                  a serial number or other identification system.The NPRM also
                  asks for comment on a proposed additional transition rule as
                  the automotive industry develops the ability to trace certain
                  low-value materials with precision. The NPRM proposes a
                  temporary transition rule through 2026 that would give the
                  industry time to develop tracing standards for these
                  low-value materials. The guidance asks for comment on the
                  need for and design of such a rule, what materials should be
                  included under this approach, and whether alternative
                  approaches to such a transition rule would be more
                  appropriate.To allow compliant vehicles already on dealer
                  lots and currently being manufactured to qualify for the
                  credit while the rulemaking process proceeds, the proposed
                  rules would provide a transition rule to expedite
                  certification for new clean vehicles that do not contain
                  battery components manufactured or assembled by a FEOC and
                  are placed in service in 2024 between January 1 and 30 days
                  after the rules are finalized.The proposed rules would also
                  create an upfront review system starting in 2025 that would
                  provide additional oversight of FEOC compliance, as well as
                  certainty to manufacturers. For new vehicles placed in
                  service in 2025 or later, the IRS would track FEOC compliance
                  via a compliant-battery ledger. Each year, automakers would
                  be required to submit to the IRS an estimate of the number of
                  FEOC-compliant batteries they expect to procure each year,
                  along with supporting documentation, and the Department of
                  Energy would review these submissions. Automakers' balances
                  would be adjusted to account for changes in the number of
                  anticipated FEOC-compliant batteries and would be reduced as
                  new credit-eligible clean vehicles are reported to the IRS.
                  Once the ledger reaches zero for a year, the automaker could
                  no longer submit vehicles as qualifying for the clean vehicle
                  credit under section 30D.Finally, the NPRM proposes a regime
                  to incentivize compliance by automakers. Inadvertent errors
                  may be cured; otherwise, the vehicle related to the error
                  will no longer be credit eligible. If that vehicle has
                  already been sold, the error would instead cause a reduction
                  to the ledger.Under the proposed enforcement framework, in
                  cases of fraud or intentional disregard for the rules, all

  abstract = "Viewing the relationship between vertical integration and product
              architecture as the ``mirroring hypothesis'', we examine the case
              of Tesla Motors. Our analysis demonstrates that, by and large,
              Tesla pursues a high degree of integrality in product
              architecture and employs significant vertical integration. Such
              congruence offers support for the mirroring hypothesis in the
              introductory stage of the electric vehicle industry. Besides
              dedicating an idiosyncratic architecture to battery issues and
              customers' range anxiety, Tesla tailors its organization and
              strategy to mesh with the demands of its other key stakeholders
              in the larger electric vehicle ecosystem by gradually mastering
              an effective systems integration.",

              was the highest-performing automaker in terms of total return,
              sales growth, and long-term shareholder value. As a technology
              and innovation scholar, the author has studied how innovators
              commercialize new technologies and found that Tesla's strategy
              offers enduring lessons for any innovator, especially in terms of
              how to win support for an idea and how to bring new technologies
              to market. To understand Tesla's strategy, one must separate its
              two primary pillars: headline-grabbing moves like launching the
              Cybertruck or the Roadster 2.0 and the big bets it is making on
              its core vehicles, the models S, X, 3, and Y.",
